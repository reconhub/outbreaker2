\title{Customise likelihood functions for outbreaker}
\usage{
custom_likelihoods(...)

\method{print}{custom_likelihoods}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{a named list of functions, each computing a log-likelihood component.}

\item{x}{an \code{outbreaker_config} object as returned by \code{create_config}.}
}
\value{
A named list of functions with the class \code{custom_likelihood}, each
    implementing a customised log-likelihood components of
    outbreaker. Functions which are not customised will result in a NULL
    component.

a list of named functions
}
\description{
This function is used to specify customised likelihood functions for
outbreaker. Custom functions are specified as a named list or series of
comma-separated, named arguments, indicating which log-likelihood component
they compute. Values currently available are:
}
\details{
\itemize{

\item \code{genetic}: the genetic likelihood; by default, the function
\code{cpp_ll_genetic} is used.

\item \code{timing_sampling}: the likelihood of sampling times; by default, the function
\code{cpp_ll_timing_sampling} is used.

\item \code{timing_infections}: the likelihood of infection times; by default, the function
\code{cpp_ll_timing_infections} is used.

\item \code{reporting}: the likelihood of the reporting process; by default,
the function \code{cpp_ll_reporting} is used.

\item \code{contact}: the likelihood of the contact tracing data; by default,
the function \code{cpp_ll_contact} is used.
}

All log-likelihood functions should have to following arguments:

\itemize{

\item \code{data}: a list of named items containing input data as returned by
\code{\link{outbreaker_data}}

\item \code{param}: a list of parameters with the class
\code{\link{outbreaker_param}}
